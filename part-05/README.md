# Objects

In PHP Objects are implementations of classes, which are blueprints for objects. They are a stricter version of what an array provides you. Instead of just throwing a bunch of information into a container, you build your class which has attributes and methods allowing you to understand more about this new data structure and allow it to perform actions also.
